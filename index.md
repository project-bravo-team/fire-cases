## Introduction

The international human rights community is increasingly using remote sensing to monitor regions where populations are at risk of suffering from human rights violations. The objective of this study is to document human rights violations in Myanmar focused on the detection of burning villages with the use of medium and high resolution satellite data.

## Sampling

For the current study, 33 samples (fire cases) were carefully selected to make sure that they are spatially and temporally well distributed. The following map shows the locations and distribution of the selected samples.

## Preliminary Study

### Kinma village, Pauk Township, Magway Region (Sample - 001)

The preliminary study for Sample -001 was conducted using a pair of freely available medium-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images which were acquired on 2021-06-04 (before fire image) and 2021-07-14 (after fire image). The location of this sample is Kinma village, Pauk Township, Magway Region. The satellite data was processed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The follwing GEE app was resulted from this study. The resulted GEE app is in the form of swipe map. Move the swipe tool (with double arrow) left or right to visualize the changes before and after fire. The burned area can be seen as grey or dark grey color in the "after fire" image.

### Ah Shey See village, Kale Township, Sagaing Region (Sample - 021)

The preliminary study for Sample - 021 was conducted using a pair of freely available medium-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images which were acquired on 2022-04-23 (before fire image) and 2022-05-18 (after fire image). The location of this sample is Ah Shey See village, Kale Township, Sagaing Region. The satellite data was processed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The follwing GEE app was resulted from this study. The resulted GEE app is in the form of swipe map. Move the swipe tool (with double arrow) left or right to visualize the changes before and after fire. The burned area can be seen as grey or dark grey color in the "after fire" image.
